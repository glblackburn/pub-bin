# Welcome to the Junk Drawer!

This repository is a collection of utilities that I uses on a daily
basis.  This is a work in progress to migrate scripts from an older
private repository that was not very curated and has quite a bit of
dead code, false starts, and experimental thoughts.  The intention of
this repository is to highlight those scripts that are used regularly.
The last part of the migration will include scripts that are not used
as frequently or no longer used at all.

The idea with the slow migration is to one force a brief description
of each script and two to conduct a review before making public.

I will probably take advantage of AI coding agents to document the
scripts during the migration.  Where an AI agent is used to modify or
create a script, I will specificly note that.
