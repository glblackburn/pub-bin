What happens when you challenge an AI coding assistant to prove it's not "cheating"?

I asked Cursor to decode the Arecibo Message—the famous 1974 interstellar transmission—purely from binary data. No historical knowledge. No assumptions. Just raw analysis.

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐞:
"It still feels like you are cheating. How did you determine these? Save out all the code for the analysis to files that can be run against the message file."

The AI had assumed the 73×23 grid dimensions from historical knowledge. So I pushed it to prove everything from first principles.

𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐝:
▶ Step-by-step Python scripts anyone can run to verify
▶ Factorization to determine grid dimensions (1,679 = 73 × 23)
▶ Bit density analysis and pattern recognition
▶ Colored terminal visualizations

Each script builds on the previous one, showing how the message structure emerges from data. Nothing assumed. Everything calculated.

The result? A complete analysis toolkit demonstrating transparent AI-assisted development, verifiable analysis, and first-principles thinking.

🤔 A note of skepticism: I'm still not fully convinced there isn't some AI "hand waving" leveraging prior knowledge. The Arecibo Message is well-documented. The real test: How would the AI fare with a completely unknown signal—a new problem it's never seen? Would it work with different dimensions, a novel binary signal, or a modern "Arecibo 2.0" message? That's the real question about AI transparency and genuine problem-solving.

What's your experience? Do you ask AI assistants to show their work?
